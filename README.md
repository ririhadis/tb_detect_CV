# TB Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements deep learning models to detect Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images. Two approaches are compared: a custom CNN model and a pre-trained MobileNet model using transfer learning.

## Models
- CNN (from scratch)
- MobileNetV2 (pre-trained)

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
- Sensitivity (Recall for TB)
- Specificity
- PPV & NPV
- ROC Curve (AUC)

## Dataset
Dataset source: **DataCamp** (used for educational purposes only).

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only and not for clinical use.
